# Hi, I'm Jonas 👋

I'm a **Cyber and Computer Technology** student at Aalborg University Copenhagen with a passion for building things — from backend systems to homelabs.

I've been programming since I was 10, and over the years I've worked across web development, cybersecurity, server administration, and software engineering. I'm currently focused on developing a full-stack waste management cooperative system using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **PostgreSQL**.

When I'm not coding, I'm tinkering with my homelab (TrueNAS, OPNsense, UniFi) or racking up hours in CS2.
